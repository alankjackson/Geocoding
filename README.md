# Geocoding

Mostly Houston geocoding stuff

Here I will put my good, final code for geocoding from the census server,
from Google, and also from the City of Houston address file
https://cohgis-mycity.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/coh-address-points-pdd

I need to build a new file for geocoding blocks by finding the average
location of each block in the COH file.
